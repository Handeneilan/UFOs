## Purpose

Our goal of this project was to customize a webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. 

We did build a table using the data stored in a JavaScript array. We also created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

Users can put the desired date and filter the data, and be able to see the filtered data on the right hand table.

## Summary

I guess one of the biggest drawback for me that users need to know so many parameters to filter the data. Filter search needs to be re-designed to option with only filter by date or state or city. Data is also limited only with in the US this brings limited user. If we have an option to expand our data Dana get more atraction to her website all around the world.
